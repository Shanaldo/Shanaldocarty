 <h4><u> lets's dive right into it. so here i will introduce some of my strenghts and let you all in on the little things i do to keep growing in those areas. 
  So I'm going to start with only four of my strongest, beginning with self-discipline.</h4></u></br></br>
 </center>
 <b id = 'My strongest areas'>Team Work</b><br/><br/>
 I usually do well in groups. I also enjoy contributing to team objectives, effectively communicating with team members while maintaining mutual respect, and listening while encouraging team members. While I have always enjoyed working alone, I have discovered that I thrive in team environments. 
 I've been honing my teamwork skills for the past five years and have discovered that it's a great way to reach more people and make a bigger difference. When I work with a group, I feel like I can communicate better and be more effective.

 <b>Coaching and Mentoring</b><br/><br/>
I understand that not everyone will have the time to add a third wheel to the mix, but I don't think it's a big deal. I am willing to coach others who are interested. It is a blessing to impart knowledge and assist people in identifying and realizing their full potential.
I try to improve in this area by excelling at everything I do so that when someone with limited understanding comes along, I can assist them and form a study group with them. I've been on this path for almost five years and it's been fantastic so far.

 <b>Problem Solver</b><br/><br/>
 For the past five years, I've been honing my problem-solving skills. I studied various problem-solving techniques and discovered that some work better than others. I've also worked on honing my critical thinking abilities. 
 I have also attempted to learn as much as possible about various fields in order to gain a better understanding of the problems that I am attempting to solve.

 <b><u><h4 align = 'center' id = 'summary of Chapter 4-7'>I read Chapters 4-7 of "Twelve Pillars" by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener and summarized each chapter below:</h4></u></b>
 <h3 align = 'center'>Chapter 4</h3>
 In Chapter 4, Charlie encourages Michael to write down his goals. Because Michael was unhappy with his current position in his field. 
 Charlie then explained to him that setting goals that will challenge him and force him to think differently will lead him to the future he desires. 
 He breaks it down into smaller pieces so Michael understands the difference between long-rage and short-rage goals.
<br/><br/><h3 align = 'center'>Chapter 5</h3>
Charlie explains to Michael in chapter 5 that his goals are important and that he should avoid regrets. 
Charlie elaborate on the point, distinguishing between the pain of discipline and the pain of regret. 
He then encouraged Michael to spend his days wisely because there are many opportunities each day, but only one best opportunity. 
And warned him not to fall into the trap of prioritizing urgent matters over important ones in his time management. 
He even went on to tell Michael to make his own life plans and not follow the plans of others.
<br/><br/><h3 align = 'center'>Chapter 6</h3>
In Chapter 6, Charlie taught Michael the importance of surrounding yourself with people who inspire you to do better rather than people who are constantly complaining about their lives and doing nothing to improve them.
Surround yourself with successful people if you want to be successful. You should feel empowered to improve your life in whatever way you can when you're with your friends, family, coworkers, and so on.
<br/><br/><h3 align = 'center'>Chapter 7</h3>
In Chapter 7, Charlie taught Michael the importance of continuing to study throughout one's life in order to grow and progress.
 Formal education will not guarantee your success in life. Reading books to be exposed to new worlds, thinking, and culture, observing successful people, 
 and reflecting on and learning from your own experiences are three strategies for maintaining learning.
 <h4 align = 'center' id = 'Reflection On What I Have Read'><u>Reflection On What I Have Read</u></h4>
 Goal setting, according to Chapter 4, entails deciding where you want to go and then devising a strategy to get there.
 Setting goals that push you to do things differently will lead you to the future you want. 
 Moving on to Chapter 5, I discover that we must all endure one of two types of pain: discipline pain or regret pain. 
 The difference is that discipline is measured in ounces, whereas regret is measured in tons. Every day, your best opportunities will be those that align with your overall goals and where you should spend your time.
 Then came Chapter 6, which taught me that the people I associate with have a significant influence on my attitude. Finally, Chapter 7 instilled in me the value of self-education. What you learn along the way is what allows you to keep improving and growing. Putting an emphasis on continuous learning will help you stand out.
 Knowledge is the foundation of wealth. Health education is the first step. Education is the foundation of spirituality.Â 
 <h4 align = 'center' id = 'How I Could Apply All of What I Read to My Life'><u>How I Could Apply All of What I Read to My Life</u></h4>
 How i could apply all of this to my life is to begin by writing down my future goals and to surround myself with people who are goal oriented/goal driven or who have similar goals and who inspire me to succeed.
 i would also do a lot more self-education and try not to make any mistakes so that i don't have any regrets later in life.
